##Using R

getwd() - get the name of the current working directory (useful for addressing the files stored there by name.ext)

setwd("") - setting the folder

dir() - list the content of the current folder

?FUNCTION - a help about the FUNCTION

source("scripts/myfirstcode.R") - to load the functions from the script myfirstcode.R

ls() shows the functions loaded (from the myfirstcode.R, here)

packageVersion("PACKAGE") - versoion of a package

library(PACKAGE) - load the package

c() - creating a vector ()

<- is the way of equality

TAB works with the first 2 letters of a variable - to check the value

list.files() - list all the files in the current directory

args(FUNCTION) - to check the arguments of the function

##Directories and files

dir.create("FILE") - creating a directory

file.create("NAME") - create file

file.exists("FILE") - check if a file exists

file.info("") - info about the file

file.rename("","") - renaming a file; same as file.copy()

dir.create(file.path("testdir2","testdir3"), recursive=TRUE) - creating nested directories

##Sequences

':' is always of step 1 (seq(along.with = my_seq) - same: the sequence of the length of my_seq with step 1  same as seq_along(my_seq))

rep(0, times=40) - vector of zeros, length 40

a:b, seq(a,b, by=step) - from a to be, incremented with 1

seq(a,b,length=n) - increment here doesn't matter

length() - length of a sequence

rep(c(0,1,2), times=10) - repeating vector

rep(c(0,1,2), each=10) - repeating each numner in the vector 10 times

##Vectors

atomic (one data type) and lists

vector<1 - checking if every member of the vector is less than 1: TRUE if yes, FALSE - if no

paste(my_char, collapse = " ") - concatenation of a vector members with a " " in between the members

LETTERS - predefined vector of letters in R
